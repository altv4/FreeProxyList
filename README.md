## üöÄ How to Use

You can use these proxy lists with a variety of tools and applications. Below are some examples of how to use the proxies with `wget` and `curl`.

### Using with `wget`

To use a proxy with `wget`, you can set the `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` environment variable.

**For HTTP Proxies**

```bash
export http_proxy='http://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT'
wget http://example.com
```

**For HTTPS Proxies**

```bash
export https_proxy='https://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT'
wget https://example.com
```

**For SOCKS Proxies**

`wget` does not directly support SOCKS proxies. You may need to use a tool like `proxychains` to use SOCKS proxies with `wget`.

### Using with `curl`

`curl` supports various proxy protocols.

**For HTTP Proxies**

```bash
curl -x http://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT http://example.com
```

**For HTTPS Proxies**

```bash
curl -x https://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT https://example.com
```

**For SOCKS4 Proxies**

```bash
curl --socks4 PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT http://example.com
```

**For SOCKS5 Proxies**

```bash
curl --socks5 PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT http://example.com
```
